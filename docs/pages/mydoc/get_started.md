## What do I need to run DeltaWave?
DeltaWave runs on Microsoft Windows and required .NET 4.6 framework to be installed.
The software is very CPU and memory intensive, recommended configuration at least an I7 4-core processor and 8GB or more of RAM.

```PLEASE NOTE: The software will run somewhat slowly for the first time. It will be significantly faster after this. Please let it complete the computation before closing it at least once, so that it can run much faster the next time!```

## Give it to me already!
